# Distributed Fiber Sensing -- Signal Process Method and Application

## Background
The enviroment state of detected area where there is fibre placed, can be detected by Brillouin
based distributed fibre sensing system.
Here is a data "C2100004.txt", captured by the physical devices.

## Signal Process Method
The STFT(Short time Fourier transformation) is exert on the source data.
Source Data is in 2D space(time-Amplitude).
The STFT method transfer source data into 3D(time-frequency-Amplitude) space.

## Others
A nearest power of 2 function is also called to implement STFT method.
